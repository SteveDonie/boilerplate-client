# hello world

Our application will require an HTML index page.  
This is the static entry point for the application.

```
mkdir -p app/src
touch app/src/index.html
```

modify app/src/index.html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>
<body>   
  <div id="app"></div>   
  <script src="application.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this document we basically define two things.
First, we create the <div> with id app where we will render our app.
Second, we define the .js file that will contain all the js of our app, minified: application.js.
This file will be automatically generated by webpack as explained later on under the webpack configuration.

For now, letâ€™s just create the javascript applications entry point file with some dummy code under src/:
```
touch app/src/application.js
```

modify application.js to include the following content
```
console.log('Hello World');
```

open your application in the browser
```
open app/src/index.html
```
